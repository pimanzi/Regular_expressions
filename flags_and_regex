 these are flags we use to modify how our reqular expressions are working 
 for example: 
 1. i is used for making our regular exoressiion insensitive
 2. g is usef for making the searching to be global

 these are short notes about reqular expressions
 
abc…	Letters
123…	Digits
\d	Any Digit
\D	Any Non-digit character
.	Any Character
\.	Period
[abc]	Only a, b, or c
[^abc]	Not a, b, nor c
[a-z]	Characters a to z
[0-9]	Numbers 0 to 9
\w	Any Alphanumeric character
\W	Any Non-alphanumeric character
{m}	m Repetitions
{m,n}	m to n Repetitions
*	Zero or more repetitions
+	One or more repetitions
?	Optional character
\s	Any Whitespace
\S	Any Non-whitespace character
^…$	Starts and ends
(…)	Capture Group
(a(bc))	Capture Sub-group
(.*)	Capture all
(abc|def)	Matches abc or def
/b for the word boundary
we can use \1 \2 \3 to reference various groups we captured before ex: orange orange banana banana let's match orange orange ,, regexp will be (orange)\s\1 Note this \1 will reference to the first group we captured which is orange.

                     look around syntax

look behind (?<=)
example we have these strings :
				placide.com
				mrkabisa
				kabisa
and then we want to match kabisa which is preceeded by mr but we want in our result to see kabisa only so regex will be(?<=mr)(kabisa) note: kabisa will not be selected because does not have mr before it.
look forward (?=)
